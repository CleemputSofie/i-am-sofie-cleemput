**MORE ABOUT ME**

My name is Sofie and I am an accounting and banking professional with a strong passion for bridging the gap between business and IT. I started my career in banking as a process analyst and later grew into a developer (team lead) role, developing accounting software. With over 10 years of experience in the industry, I have developed a deep understanding of both analytical and development roles. Currently, I focus on the importance of testing and quality assurance while working with agile methodologies.

**SKILLS**

I gained experience in several project/data management- and development tools: Jira, Git(Hub), VS Code, BO, and Metabase. Known markup and programming languages are: liquid, XML, HTML (basic). I developed knowledge of different methodologies such as BPMN, UML (basic), agile, and ISTQB. My native language is Dutch, and I have professional knowledge of French and English.

**INTEREST AND HOBBIES**

In my free time, I love to (trail) run and play badminton. I also recently picked up playing the piano again.
